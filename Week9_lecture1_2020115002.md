## Randomized Algorithms
<pre>
Some of the quickest and cleverest algorithms we've ever seen rely on chance: at specific phases, they continue based on the results of random coin flips. 
These randomised algorithms are frequently simple and beautiful, with a little chance that their result will be erroneous. This bound on the failure probability holds for all inputs; it only depends on the algorithm's random choices, and it can be set as tiny as desired.
Primality algorithms that are randomised are significantly easier to define and use.

## Rabin-Miller Algorithm for Primality Testing
<pre>
On input p:
1. If p is even, accept if p = 2; otherwise, reject.
2. Select a<sub>1</sub> , . . . , a<sub>k</sub> randomly in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>.
3. For each i from 1 to k:
4. Compute a<sub>i</sub><sup>p-1</sup> (mod p) and reject if != 1.
5. Let (p − 1) = st where s is odd and t = 2<sup>h</sup>.    
6. Compute the sequence a<sub>i</sub><sup>s·2<sup>0</sup></sup>, a<sub>i</sub><sup>s·2<sup>1</sup></sup>, a<sub>i</sub><sup>s·2<sup>2</sup></sup>, . . . , a<sub>i</sub><sup>s·2<sup>h</sup></sup> (mod p).
7. If some element of this sequence is not 1, find the last element that is not 1 and reject if that element is not −1.
8. All tests passed, so accept at this point.

It's worth noting that if we've gotten to line 6 of the algorithm, a<sub>i</sub><sup>s·2<sup>h</sup></sup> = 1(mod p). We say that a<sub>i</sub> is a witness (of compositness) for p if the algorithm rejects at either stage 4 or stage 7, using a<sub>i</sub>.

Lemma: 
Suppose that p is a prime number. Then the Rabin-Miller algorithm accepts it with probability 1.
Proof:
We show that no witness exists if p is prime, and hence no branch of the algorithm rejects.
If a were a stage 4 witness, a<sup>p-1</sup> != 1 (mod p) then Fermat’s little theorem would imply that p is composite. If a were a stage 7 witness, some b exists in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> , where b != ±1 (mod p) and b<sup>2</sup> = 1 (mod p).
Therefore, (b<sup>2</sup> − 1) = 0 (mod p). On factorisation, we get:
    (b − 1)(b + 1) = 0 (mod p)
which implies that p divides (b − 1)(b + 1). 
But because b != ±1 (mod p), both (b − 1) and (b + 1) are strictly between 0 and p. But that contradicts that p|(b − 1)(b + 1), because p is a prime, so to divide the RHS it has to be a factor of the RHS, but both numbers are smaller than it.

We'll now prove that the Rabin-Miller method correctly recognizes composite numbers with a high degree of certainty.
Lemma:
If p is an odd composite number then the probability that the Rabin-Miller algorithm accepts is ≤ 2<sup>-k</sup>.
Proof:
We show that if p is an odd composite number and a is chosen at random in Z<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>, then Pr[ a is a witness ] ≥ (1/2) follows.
The sequence generated in stage 6 for each nonwitness is either all 1s or contains a -1 at some point, followed by 1s. As an example, 1 is a first-kind nonwitness, while -1 is a second-kind nonwitness because s is odd and (-1)<sup>s·2<sup>0</sup></sup> = −1 (mod p) and (-1)<sup>s·2<sup>1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p).
Find the nonwitness with the -1 in the largest position in the sequence among all nonwitnesses of the second sort. Let x be the nonwitness, and j be the position of -1 in its series, where the positions are numbered starting at 0.
Hence, x<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> = −1 (mod p) and x<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p).

Because p is composite, we can represent it as the product of two co-prime numbers, q and r, or as the power of a prime. There are two possibilities as a result of this.
Case 1:
Suppose that p = q<sup>e</sup> where q is prime and e > 1. Let t = 1 + q<sup>e-1</sup>. From the binomial expansion of t<sup>p</sup> we obtain:
    t<sup>p</sup> = (1 + q<sup>e-1</sup>)<sup>p</sup> = 1 + pq<sup>e-1</sup> + “multiples of higher power of q<sup>e-1</sup>” 
which is congruent to 1 (mod p). Hence t is a stage 4 witness because, if t<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod p), then t<sup>p</sup> = t (mod p), which from the above equation is not possible.
We use this one witness to get many others. If d is a (stage 4) nonwitness, we have d<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod p), but then dt (mod p) is a witness. Moreover, if d1, d2 are distinct nonwitnesses, then d<sub>1</sub>t != d<sub>2</sub>t (mod p). Otherwise,
    d<sub>1</sub> = d<sub>1</sub> · t · t<sup>p-1</sup> = d<sub>2</sub> · t · t<sup>p-1</sup> = d<sub>2</sub> (mod p)
As a result, the number of (stage 4) witnesses must equal or exceed the number of nonwitnesses.
Case 2:
By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) there exists t ∈ Z<sup>p</sup> such that:
    t = x (mod q) ⇒ t<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> = −1 (mod q)
    t = 1 (mod r) ⇒ t<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> = 1 (mod r)
Hence t is a witness because t<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> != ±1 (mod p) but t<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p).
We can now gather many more witnesses and demonstrate that dt (mod p) is a unique witness for each nonwitness d by making two observations:
1. d<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> = ±1 (mod p) and d<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p) owing to the way that j was chosen. Therefore dt (mod p) is a witness because dt<sup>s·2<sup>j</sup></sup> != ±1 (mod p) and dt<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p).
2. If d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> are distinct nonwitnesses, d<sub>1</sub>t != d<sub>2</sub>t (mod p) because t<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup></sup> = 1 (mod p). Hence t · t<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup>-1</sup> = 1 (mod p). Therefore, if d<sub>1</sub>t = d<sub>2</sub>t (mod p), then:
    d<sub>1</sub> = d<sub>1</sub>t · t<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup>-1</sup> = d<sub>2</sub>t · t<sup>s·2<sup>j+1</sup>-1</sup> = d<sub>2</sub> (mod p)

As a result, the number of witnesses in Case 2 must be at least equal to the number of nonwitnesses.

Therefore, we have a solid randomised primality algorithm: no false negatives and false positives with probability ≤ 1/2<sup>k</sup>.
