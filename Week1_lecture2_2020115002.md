## Countable Sets

An infinite set is countable if there is a bijection f : N -> S from the natural numbers to S.

### Theorem:

The set of finite length bit strings {0,1}* is countable.

## Uncountable Sets

A set is uncountable if it is not countable.

### Theorem:

The power set of bit strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable.

### Proof:

Any subset T in P ({0,1}*) can be viewed as a function  f:{0,1}* -> {0,1}.  This is done by making the function take the value 1 for elements in the set, and the value 0 for elements not in the set.

Suppose that P ({0,1}*) were countable. Thus it would be possible to find a bijection from N to P({0,1}*)
Hence,  we can list all binary languages as a sequence L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 , L5 , L6 , L7, ... supposedly containing every language of bit strings. 

#### Cantor’s Diabolical Diagonal:

Cantor’s diabolical diagonalization argument creates a language L that’s not on the list. This would prove that P({0,1}*) is not countable.

L is created as follows:  

The j<sup>th</sup> column of L is the opposite of the j<sup>th</sup> column of the j<sup>th</sup> row L<sub>i</sub>.  In other words, L is the anti-diagonal of the table. This guarantees that L disagrees with every listed language (L<sub>i</sub> differs in the i<sup>th</sup> column)

## Connecting to computing

### Theorem:

There are computational problems that computers cannot solve!

### Proof:

We show that there are many more computational problems than computer programs.

- Every computer program can be encoded in binary by some string.  
- Consequently the cardinality of the set of programs is no greater than that of {0,1}*
- Since {0,1}* is countable, set of all programs is countable.

- Problems are (membership queries) in Languages.
- Hence, the set of all problems has the same cardinality as P({0,1}*)
- Since P({0,1}*) is uncountable, set of all problems is uncountable.

## Turing Machine

- TM is a 7-tuple (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, q<sub>accept</sub>, q<sub>reject</sub>)
  - Q is the finite set of states.
  - Σ is the finite input alphabet set, not containing blank.
  - Γ is the finite tape alphabet, with blank.
  - δ : (Q x Γ)  to  (Q X Γ x {L,R}) is the transition function.
  - q<sub>0</sub>  is the start state.
  - q<sub>accept</sub> is the accept state.
  - q<sub>reject</sub> is the reject state.
